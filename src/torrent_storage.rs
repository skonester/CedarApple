//! Ported from Frame Player (src-tauri/src/torrent_storage.rs, GPL-3.0-or-later,
//! Copyright (c) Evgenii Zakharov).
//!
//! Torrent storage that opens a file when it is read and closes it when the
//! budget says so.
//!
//! **librqbit's own storage holds one open file descriptor per file of the
//! torrent, for as long as the torrent is in the session** — see
//! `FilesystemStorage::init` in the vendored crate, which walks every entry of
//! `file_infos` and keeps what it opened. That is a fine trade for a headless
//! client with one torrent in flight, and a bad one here: persistence restores
//! *every* torrent ever added when the session is built, and each of them pays
//! its whole file list forever. Measured on one real installation: 9 torrents,
//! 135 files, 144 descriptors held — one of them a Blu-ray release whose BDMV
//! folder is 79 `.clpi`/`.mpls`/`.m2ts` files on its own, none of which anybody
//! was watching.
//!
//! What that cost is in `raise_fd_limit` (lib.rs), and it is worth reading
//! before touching this file: the ceiling is not a torrent problem, it is the
//! moment the process loses hardware decoding and its audio clock, permanently.
//! Raising the limit removes the cliff; this removes the waste, so the budget
//! is spent on what is actually being watched rather than on nine seasons
//! sitting still.
//!
//! The shape is the smallest one that can do that. A file is a path until
//! somebody reads or writes it; the descriptor it then gets is registered with
//! a pool, and when the pool is over its budget the oldest one is closed. A
//! closed file reopens on its next access — positional reads and writes carry
//! their own offset, so nothing is lost across that and nobody has to be told.
//!
//! Three properties this deliberately keeps, because each of them is load
//! bearing somewhere else in the player:
//!
//! - **The files are still created at `init`**, exactly as upstream creates
//!   them. `only_files: Some(vec![])` means nothing is selected and nothing is
//!   preallocated, but every file of the torrent still comes into existence as
//!   an empty file — which is what `torrent_offline_file` and `dir_size` have
//!   been reading all along. Opening lazily must change how many descriptors
//!   are held, never what is on the disk.
//! - **Windows still gets `FSCTL_SET_SPARSE` before the first write.** NTFS has
//!   no sparse file unless somebody asks, and upstream 9.x asks on the first
//!   write rather than at creation; this does the same, once per descriptor's
//!   lifetime, or a nine-episode season occupies all of itself again.
//! - **`take()` leaves the old storage useless**, which is what librqbit means
//!   by it — it is how a torrent being paused or deleted stops writing through
//!   a storage somebody else may still hold.
